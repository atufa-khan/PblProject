# 🌾 Agri-Horti Commodity Price Prediction System

This project aims to build an intelligent system using machine learning to **predict the future prices of agri-horticultural commodities** such as **pulses, onions, and potatoes**. By leveraging historical trends, weather data, and market variables, the system is designed to support **retailers**, **farmers**, and **policymakers** in making data-driven decisions regarding inventory management and strategic stock release.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict the future prices of key agri-horticultural commodities.
- Enable informed decision-making for:
- Retailers – for effective inventory and pricing strategy.
- Policymakers – for releasing buffer stocks during price surges or shortages.
- Promote **food security**, reduce **wastage**, and **maximize profits**.
